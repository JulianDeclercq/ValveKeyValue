# Valve's KeyValue for .NET - Fork

## Differences with the original repository:

* Don't order object members alphabetically by
  name ([original issue](https://github.com/ValveResourceFormat/ValveKeyValue/issues/80))
* Target `net7.0` (related to first change, to have deterministic object member ordering based on the metadata ordering
  in the assembly)
